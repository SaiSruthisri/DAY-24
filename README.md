# DAY-24
Is Sunseqence

Problem Statement

To check if a string is subsequence of given string.

For Example , s = "abc" is subsequence of t = "ahbgdc"

Solution Approach 

Assume subseqence string s ,given string is t.Intialise sIndex & tIndex to zero.Run a while loop until both string's index reaches their respective sizes.Increment tIndex in each iteration.But if both index give same element then increment sIndex.
